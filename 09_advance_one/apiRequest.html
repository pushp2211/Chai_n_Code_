     //what is happening here is that we are making an API request to a placeholder API and logging the ready state changes to the console.
     //this helps us understand the different stages of the request lifecycle.
     //we do api call asynchronously by passing true as the third parameter to open() method.
     //but is this standard way of making API calls in javascript? no, nowadays we use fetch API or libraries like axios for making API requests as they provide
