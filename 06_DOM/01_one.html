//DOM: what is it?
//DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents.
//It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programming languages to manipulate
//the content, structure, and style of a document.
//The DOM provides a way to access and modify the elements of a web page, such as HTML tags, attributes, and text content.
//It is a language-neutral interface, meaning it can be used with various programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and others.
//The DOM is created by the browser when a web page is loaded, and it can be manipulated using JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
